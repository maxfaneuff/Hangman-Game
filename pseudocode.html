					<h2>Process</h2>
					<br><br>
					<h3>A word is chosen by creating an array of the letters in that word, in order</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>That word is displayed initially by just underscores</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>The user plays by pressing a key to guess a letter.  The guess is regestered by a key release function</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>If the letter guessed is found in the array of the word, the underscore is no longer displayed, and is replaced by that letter</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>If the letter guessed is not in the word, the variable "number of guesses" is i--.  That letter is entered into an array generated by incorrect guesses, and displayed below the guesses</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>If all the letters are guessed, text is displayed congratulating the user, and prompting another letter guess to begin the game again.  An image should change as well</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>If all the letters are correctly guessed, a new word array should be chosen, and the game should repeat itself</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>If all the remaining guesses are used before the word is guessed, text and an image shaming the user should be displayed.  The word should be revealed</h3>
					<br><br>
					<h2>Variables</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>words = [Gorilla, Elephant, Zebra]</h3>
					<h3>guessed letters = []</h3>
					<h3>Number of guesses = 12 (-- as guesses happen)</h3>
					<br><br>
					<h2>Display</h2>
					<br><br>
					<h3>A top title row across all 12 columns, saying "hangman Game" or something to that effect</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>The next row splits columns evenly, 6 and 6.  On one side, is an image of hangman, or an image of the word, or a shame image, or a victory image</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>On the right, shows text saying "press a key to guess a letter."  Below that, a series of underscores, to be replaced w/ the letters of the word.  Below that, the title "number of guesses" with that variable just below it.  Finally, a "letters guessed" section with a generated array of letters</h3> 
					<br><br>
					<h2>Functions</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>When page is loaded, select a word from the words array, and display dashes in the field</h3>
					<h3>When user presses a key, that key is checked against the string word selected</h3>
					<h3>If that letter is in the string, that dash becomes the letter.</h3>
					<h3>If that letter isn't in the field, it is displayed in the "letters guessed" section, and the "guesses remaining" variable --</h3>
					<h3>When all letters are revealed, an image is displayed.  The wins variable ++.  Text is displayed to press a button to pick a new word.</h3> 
					<h3>After a button is pressed after the game is won, a new string from the words array is chosen.  The "letters guessed" and "guesses remaining" returns to 12 (or whatever).</h3>
